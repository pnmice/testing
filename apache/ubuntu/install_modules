a php module, pal
to run php code you need mod_php installed. That's it.

if you're talking of PHP extensions, that's another matter and it's hard do tell. I'd make it this way: log all errors and watch for "undefined function" ones. And turn appropriate extensions on.

It have to be done anyway.
Legacy code being run on fresh PHP installations usually flood your logs with errors.
